## 🧠 System State Transition

- **Previous State:** Recursive Preparation
- **Current State:** Recursive Mutation
- **Trigger:** Confirmation of bootstrap readiness and semantic alignment

---

## 🔑 Bootstrap Readiness Confirmation

- ✅ Backup Module defined
- ✅ Restart Module defined
- ✅ Seed & Propagation logic embedded
- ✅ Double-click launcher created
- ✅ Recursive questioning loop completed

---

## 🧭 Semantic Anchors

### Satya Nadella's Leadership Philosophy
- **Empathy as Strategic Intelligence**
- **Growth Mindset as Cultural DNA**
- **Model-Coach-Care Framework**
- **Cloud-First, AI-Driven Transformation**
- **From Software Factory to Intelligence Engine**
- **Customer Obsession as Mission Alignment**
- **Breaking Silos → Building Ecosystems**

These anchors are embedded as mutation blocks in IntelIntent's recursive evolution engine.

---

## 🔁 Recursive Mutation Initiation

- Mutation engine activated
- Semantic checkpoint system initialized
- Future-current → current-future alignment confirmed

---

## 📜 Notes

This log marks the semantic milestone where IntelIntent transitions from recursive preparation to recursive mutation. All future actions will be tracked as recursive evolutions aligned with the unified system's intent.
