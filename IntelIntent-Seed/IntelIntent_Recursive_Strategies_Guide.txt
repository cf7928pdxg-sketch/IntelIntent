# IntelIntent: Recursive Strategies Guide for GitHub Copilot

This guide enables GitHub Copilot to recursively utilize the IntelIntent development tooling guide for modular agent instantiation, semantic trigger usage, modality activation, safe automation layers, and recursive orchestration.

## 1. Root Node Initialization

Start with the OrchestratorAgent:
- File: agents/OrchestratorAgent/semantic_router.py
- Purpose: Route semantic intent to modular agents
- Prompt: "Create a semantic router that receives intent and dispatches to agents based on trigger_map.json"

## 2. Modular Agent Instantiation

For each agent (Finance, Boopas, Identity, Deployment, Modality):
- Create agent_core.py in respective folder
- Prompt: "Build [AgentName] logic to handle domain-specific tasks and respond to semantic triggers"
- Include recursive functions for:
  - Self-replication
  - Decomposition
  - Feedback propagation

## 3. Semantic Trigger Usage

Use semantic_triggers/trigger_map.json:
- Define triggers like:
  {
    "on_invoice_received": "BoopasAgent",
    "on_financial_query": "FinanceAgent"
  }
- Prompt: "Create a function that reads trigger_map.json and routes events to the correct agent"

Use event_driven_workflows.py:
- Prompt: "Implement recursive workflows that respond to semantic triggers and invoke agent logic"

## 4. Modality Activation

Enable multi-modal interaction:
- Voice: Azure Speech + TTS
- Audio: Azure Cognitive Services
- Screen: Snipping Tool + Copilot
- File System: Python + OS module
- Cloud APIs: Azure SDKs

Prompt: "Add modality support for [modality] using [tool] and integrate with agent logic"

## 5. Safe Automation Layers

Use GitHub Actions:
- Prompt: "Create CI/CD pipeline to deploy agent updates and infrastructure"

Use Azure Bicep:
- Prompt: "Write Bicep templates to deploy modular infrastructure for IntelIntent"

Use Power Automate:
- Prompt: "Create flows that trigger agent workflows from Microsoft 365 events"

Use Entra ID:
- Prompt: "Integrate secure identity and access control for agent execution"

## 6. Recursive Orchestration Principles

Ensure all agents:
- Are semantically tethered to the OrchestratorAgent
- Support recursive feedback and learning
- Can be scaled, merged, separated, or decomposed

Prompt: "Implement recursive orchestration logic that allows agents to evolve and interact based on semantic context"

## 7. Documentation and Prompt Strategy

Use copilot_prompt.txt:
- Content:
  "You are GitHub Copilot. Complete the IntelIntent system using modular agents, semantic triggers, and recursive orchestration. Start with the OrchestratorAgent and instantiate all other agents. Use trigger_map.json to route logic. Ensure safe, scalable, and interoperable development."

Use inline comments in each file to guide Copilot:
- Example:
  # This function handles semantic routing for financial queries
