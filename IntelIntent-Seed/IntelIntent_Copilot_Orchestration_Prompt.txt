# IntelIntent GitHub Orchestration: Fresh Restart Protocol

## Objective:
Initiate a complete reset and recursive reconfiguration of both GitHub Personal and GitHub Enterprise environments for the IntelIntent project.

## Step 1: Remove Legacy Configurations
- Identify and archive all legacy repositories, workflows, and configuration files.
- Delete deprecated branches, unused forks, and outdated CI/CD pipelines.
- Clear stale secrets, tokens, and environment variables from both environments.

## Step 2: Reset Repositories
- Create new repositories for:
  - IntelIntent_Core
  - IntelIntent_CoE_Modules
  - IntelIntent_Fluent2_Interface
  - IntelIntent_URMTO_Engine
  - IntelIntent_Feedback_Systems
- Initialize each repository with a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore file.
- Set up protected branches and semantic versioning.

## Step 3: Recursively Configure GitHub Personal
- Enable GitHub Copilot for personal account.
- Configure Copilot to generate atomic components from semantic manifest.
- Set up recursive feedback workflows using GitHub Actions.
- Link repositories to personal dashboard for modular orchestration.

## Step 4: Recursively Configure GitHub Enterprise
- Enable GitHub Copilot Enterprise features.
- Configure enterprise-level access controls and team permissions.
- Set up recursive CI/CD pipelines for modular deployment.
- Integrate semantic dashboards and feedback loops across teams.

## Step 5: Semantic Alignment and Feedback Systems
- Embed semantic metadata in each repository (intent, context, execution).
- Create recursive feedback workflows using GitHub Issues and Discussions.
- Implement journaling protocol for post-cursive reflection.

## Final Step: Verification and Activation
- Validate recursive integrity of all modules.
- Confirm semantic alignment with IntelIntent manifest.
- Activate orchestration and monitor recursive execution.
